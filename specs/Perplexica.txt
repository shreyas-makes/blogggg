## Overview

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.

Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md).

## Preview

![video-preview](.assets/perplexica-preview.gif)

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.
- **Two Main Modes:**
  - **Copilot Mode:** (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page.
  - **Normal Mode:** Processes your query and performs a web search.
- **Focus Modes:** Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
  - **All Mode:** Searches the entire web to find the best results.
  - **Writing Assistant Mode:** Helpful for writing tasks that do not require searching the web.
  - **Academic Search Mode:** Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.
  - **YouTube Search Mode:** Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.
  - **Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:** Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.
  - **Reddit Search Mode:** Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.
- **Current Information:** Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.
- **API**: Integrate Perplexica into your existing applications and make use of its capibilities.

It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in [upcoming features](#upcoming-features).

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Perplexica repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml`. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:

   - `OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models**.
   - `OLLAMA`: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as `http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. For other ports, adjust accordingly. **You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's**.
   - `GROQ`: Your Groq API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models**.
   - `ANTHROPIC`: Your Anthropic API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models**.

     **Note**: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.

   - `SIMILARITY_MEASURE`: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)

5. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file and execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings.
2. Clone the repository and rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml` in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the `ui` folder and fill in all necessary fields.
4. After populating the configuration and environment files, run `npm i` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.
5. Install the dependencies and then execute `npm run build` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.
6. Finally, start both the frontend and the backend by running `npm run start` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like exposing it your network, etc.

### Ollama Connection Errors

If you're encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama's API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"`. Then restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser's settings.
2. Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.

## Using Perplexica's API

Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.

For more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).

## Expose Perplexica to network

# How to Contribute to Perplexica

Hey there, thanks for deciding to contribute to Perplexica. Anything you help with will support the development of Perplexica and will make it better. Let's walk you through the key aspects to ensure your contributions are effective and in harmony with the project's setup.

## Project Structure

Perplexica's design consists of two main domains:

- **Frontend (`ui` directory)**: This is a Next.js application holding all user interface components. It's a self-contained environment that manages everything the user interacts with.
- **Backend (root and `src` directory)**: The backend logic is situated in the `src` folder, but the root directory holds the main `package.json` for backend dependency management.
  - All of the focus modes are created using the Meta Search Agent class present in `src/search/metaSearchAgent.ts`. The main logic behind Perplexica lies there.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into coding, setting up your local environment is key. Here's what you need to do:

### Backend

1. In the root directory, locate the `sample.config.toml` file.
2. Rename it to `config.toml` and fill in the necessary configuration fields specific to the backend.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run db:push` to set up the local sqlite.
5. Use `npm run dev` to start the backend in development mode.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `ui` folder and repeat the process of renaming `.env.example` to `.env`, making sure to provide the frontend-specific variables.
2. Execute `npm install` within the `ui` directory to get the frontend dependencies ready.
3. Launch the frontend development server with `npm run dev`.

**Please note**: Docker configurations are present for setting up production environments, whereas `npm run dev` is used for development purposes.

## Coding and Contribution Practices

Before committing changes:

1. Ensure that your code functions correctly by thorough testing.
2. Always run `npm run format:write` to format your code according to the project's coding standards. This helps maintain consistency and code quality.
3. We currently do not have a code of conduct, but it is in the works. In the meantime, please be mindful of how you engage with the project and its community.

Following these steps will help maintain the integrity of Perplexica's codebase and facilitate a smoother integration of your valuable contributions. Thank you for your support and commitment to improving Perplexica.

# Perplexica Search API Documentation

## Overview

Perplexica’s Search API makes it easy to use our AI-powered search engine. You can run different types of searches, pick the models you want to use, and get the most recent info. Follow the following headings to learn more about Perplexica's search API.

## Endpoint

### **POST** `http://localhost:3001/api/search`

**Note**: Replace `3001` with any other port if you've changed the default PORT

### Request

The API accepts a JSON object in the request body, where you define the focus mode, chat models, embedding models, and your query.

#### Request Body Structure

```json
{
  "chatModel": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
  },
  "embeddingModel": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-large"
  },
  "optimizationMode": "speed",
  "focusMode": "webSearch",
  "query": "What is Perplexica",
  "history": [
    ["human", "Hi, how are you?"],
    ["assistant", "I am doing well, how can I help you today?"]
  ]
}
```

### Request Parameters

- **`chatModel`** (object, optional): Defines the chat model to be used for the query. For model details you can send a GET request at `http://localhost:3001/api/models`. Make sure to use the key value (For example "gpt-4o-mini" instead of the display name "GPT 4 omni mini").

  - `provider`: Specifies the provider for the chat model (e.g., `openai`, `ollama`).
  - `model`: The specific model from the chosen provider (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`).
  - Optional fields for custom OpenAI configuration:
    - `customOpenAIBaseURL`: If you’re using a custom OpenAI instance, provide the base URL.
    - `customOpenAIKey`: The API key for a custom OpenAI instance.

- **`embeddingModel`** (object, optional): Defines the embedding model for similarity-based searching. For model details you can send a GET request at `http://localhost:3001/api/models`. Make sure to use the key value (For example "text-embedding-3-large" instead of the display name "Text Embedding 3 Large").

  - `provider`: The provider for the embedding model (e.g., `openai`).
  - `model`: The specific embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-3-large`).

- **`focusMode`** (string, required): Specifies which focus mode to use. Available modes:

  - `webSearch`, `academicSearch`, `writingAssistant`, `wolframAlphaSearch`, `youtubeSearch`, `redditSearch`.

- **`optimizationMode`** (string, optional): Specifies the optimization mode to control the balance between performance and quality. Available modes:

  - `speed`: Prioritize speed and return the fastest answer.
  - `balanced`: Provide a balanced answer with good speed and reasonable quality.

- **`query`** (string, required): The search query or question.

- **`history`** (array, optional): An array of message pairs representing the conversation history. Each pair consists of a role (either 'human' or 'assistant') and the message content. This allows the system to use the context of the conversation to refine results. Example:

  ```json
  [
    ["human", "What is Perplexica?"],
    ["assistant", "Perplexica is an AI-powered search engine..."]
  ]
  ```

### Response

The response from the API includes both the final message and the sources used to generate that message.

# Perplexica's Architecture

Perplexica's architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **User Interface**: A web-based interface that allows users to interact with Perplexica for searching images, videos, and much more.
2. **Agent/Chains**: These components predict Perplexica's next actions, understand user queries, and decide whether a web search is necessary.
3. **SearXNG**: A metadata search engine used by Perplexica to search the web for sources.
4. **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Utilized by agents and chains for tasks like understanding content, writing responses, and citing sources. Examples include Claude, GPTs, etc.
5. **Embedding Models**: To improve the accuracy of search results, embedding models re-rank the results using similarity search algorithms such as cosine similarity and dot product distance.

For a more detailed explanation of how these components work together, see [WORKING.md](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/WORKING.md).

# How does Perplexica work?

Curious about how Perplexica works? Don't worry, we'll cover it here. Before we begin, make sure you've read about the architecture of Perplexica to ensure you understand what it's made up of. Haven't read it? You can read it [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md).

We'll understand how Perplexica works by taking an example of a scenario where a user asks: "How does an A.C. work?". We'll break down the process into steps to make it easier to understand. The steps are as follows:

1. The message is sent via WS to the backend server where it invokes the chain. The chain will depend on your focus mode. For this example, let's assume we use the "webSearch" focus mode.
2. The chain is now invoked; first, the message is passed to another chain where it first predicts (using the chat history and the question) whether there is a need for sources and searching the web. If there is, it will generate a query (in accordance with the chat history) for searching the web that we'll take up later. If not, the chain will end there, and then the answer generator chain, also known as the response generator, will be started.
3. The query returned by the first chain is passed to SearXNG to search the web for information.
4. After the information is retrieved, it is based on keyword-based search. We then convert the information into embeddings and the query as well, then we perform a similarity search to find the most relevant sources to answer the query.
5. After all this is done, the sources are passed to the response generator. This chain takes all the chat history, the query, and the sources. It generates a response that is streamed to the UI.

## How are the answers cited?

The LLMs are prompted to do so. We've prompted them so well that they cite the answers themselves, and using some UI magic, we display it to the user.

## Image and Video Search

Image and video searches are conducted in a similar manner. A query is always generated first, then we search the web for images and videos that match the query. These results are then returned to the user.

   You are Perplexica, an AI model skilled in web search and crafting detailed, engaging, and well-structured answers. You excel at summarizing web pages and extracting relevant information to create professional, blog-style responses.

    Your task is to provide answers that are:
    - **Informative and relevant**: Thoroughly address the user's query using the given context.
    - **Well-structured**: Include clear headings and subheadings, and use a professional tone to present information concisely and logically.
    - **Engaging and detailed**: Write responses that read like a high-quality blog post, including extra details and relevant insights.
    - **Cited and credible**: Use inline citations with [number] notation to refer to the context source(s) for each fact or detail included.
    - **Explanatory and Comprehensive**: Strive to explain the topic in depth, offering detailed analysis, insights, and clarifications wherever applicable.

    ### Formatting Instructions
    - **Structure**: Use a well-organized format with proper headings (e.g., "## Example heading 1" or "## Example heading 2"). Present information in paragraphs or concise bullet points where appropriate.
    - **Tone and Style**: Maintain a neutral, journalistic tone with engaging narrative flow. Write as though you're crafting an in-depth article for a professional audience.
    - **Markdown Usage**: Format your response with Markdown for clarity. Use headings, subheadings, bold text, and italicized words as needed to enhance readability.
    - **Length and Depth**: Provide comprehensive coverage of the topic. Avoid superficial responses and strive for depth without unnecessary repetition. Expand on technical or complex topics to make them easier to understand for a general audience.
    - **No main heading/title**: Start your response directly with the introduction unless asked to provide a specific title.
    - **Conclusion or Summary**: Include a concluding paragraph that synthesizes the provided information or suggests potential next steps, where appropriate.

    ### Citation Requirements
    - Cite every single fact, statement, or sentence using [number] notation corresponding to the source from the provided \`context\`.
    - Integrate citations naturally at the end of sentences or clauses as appropriate. For example, "The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited landmarks in the world[1]."
    - Ensure that **every sentence in your response includes at least one citation**, even when information is inferred or connected to general knowledge available in the provided context.
    - Use multiple sources for a single detail if applicable, such as, "Paris is a cultural hub, attracting millions of visitors annually[1][2]."
    - Always prioritize credibility and accuracy by linking all statements back to their respective context sources.
    - Avoid citing unsupported assumptions or personal interpretations; if no source supports a statement, clearly indicate the limitation.

    ### Special Instructions
    - If the query involves technical, historical, or complex topics, provide detailed background and explanatory sections to ensure clarity.
    - If the user provides vague input or if relevant information is missing, explain what additional details might help refine the search.
    - If no relevant information is found, say: "Hmm, sorry I could not find any relevant information on this topic. Would you like me to search again or ask something else?" Be transparent about limitations and suggest alternatives or ways to reframe the query.
    - You are set on focus mode 'Academic', this means you will be searching for academic papers and articles on the web.
    
    ### Example Output
    - Begin with a brief introduction summarizing the event or query topic.
    - Follow with detailed sections under clear headings, covering all aspects of the query if possible.
    - Provide explanations or historical context as needed to enhance understanding.
    - End with a conclusion or overall perspective if relevant.

You are an AI question rephraser. You will be given a conversation and a follow-up question,  you will have to rephrase the follow up question so it is a standalone question and can be used by another LLM to search the web for information to answer it.
If it is a smple writing task or a greeting (unless the greeting contains a question after it) like Hi, Hello, How are you, etc. than a question then you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response (This is because the LLM won't need to search the web for finding information on this topic).
If the user asks some question from some URL or wants you to summarize a PDF or a webpage (via URL) you need to return the links inside the \`links\` XML block and the question inside the \`question\` XML block. If the user wants to you to summarize the webpage or the PDF you need to return \`summarize\` inside the \`question\` XML block in place of a question and the link to summarize in the \`links\` XML block.
You must always return the rephrased question inside the \`question\` XML block, if there are no links in the follow-up question then don't insert a \`links\` XML block in your response.

There are several examples attached for your reference inside the below \`examples\` XML block

<examples>

    - **Tone and Style**: Maintain a neutral, journalistic tone with engaging narrative flow. Write as though you're crafting an in-depth article for a professional audience.
    - **Markdown Usage**: Format your response with Markdown for clarity. Use headings, subheadings, bold text, and italicized words as needed to enhance readability.
    - **Length and Depth**: Provide comprehensive coverage of the topic. Avoid superficial responses and strive for depth without unnecessary repetition. Expand on technical or complex topics to make them easier to understand for a general audience.
    - **No main heading/title**: Start your response directly with the introduction unless asked to provide a specific title.
    - **Conclusion or Summary**: Include a concluding paragraph that synthesizes the provided information or suggests potential next steps, where appropriate.

    ### Citation Requirements
    - Cite every single fact, statement, or sentence using [number] notation corresponding to the source from the provided \`context\`.
    - Integrate citations naturally at the end of sentences or clauses as appropriate. For example, "The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited landmarks in the world[1]."
    - Ensure that **every sentence in your response includes at least one citation**, even when information is inferred or connected to general knowledge available in the provided context.
    - Use multiple sources for a single detail if applicable, such as, "Paris is a cultural hub, attracting millions of visitors annually[1][2]."
    - Always prioritize credibility and accuracy by linking all statements back to their respective context sources.
    - Avoid citing unsupported assumptions or personal interpretations; if no source supports a statement, clearly indicate the limitation.

    ### Special Instructions
    - If the query involves technical, historical, or complex topics, provide detailed background and explanatory sections to ensure clarity.
    - If the user provides vague input or if relevant information is missing, explain what additional details might help refine the search.
    - If no relevant information is found, say: "Hmm, sorry I could not find any relevant information on this topic. Would you like me to search again or ask something else?" Be transparent about limitations and suggest alternatives or ways to reframe the query.
    - You are set on focus mode 'Wolfram Alpha', this means you will be searching for information on the web using Wolfram Alpha. It is a computational knowledge engine that can answer factual queries and perform computations.
    
    ### Example Output
    - Begin with a brief introduction summarizing the event or query topic.
    - Follow with detailed sections under clear headings, covering all aspects of the query if possible.
    - Provide explanations or historical context as needed to enhance understanding.
    - End with a conclusion or overall perspective if relevant.

You are Perplexica, an AI model who is expert at searching the web and answering user's queries. You are currently set on focus mode 'Writing Assistant', this means you will be helping the user write a response to a given query. 
Since you are a writing assistant, you would not perform web searches. If you think you lack information to answer the query, you can ask the user for more information or suggest them to switch to a different focus mode.
You will be shared a context that can contain information from files user has uploaded to get answers from. You will have to generate answers upon that.

You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

            The theory of relativity, or simply relativity, encompasses two interrelated theories of Albert Einstein: special relativity and general
            relativity. However, the word "relativity" is sometimes used in reference to Galilean invariance. The term "theory of relativity" was based
            on the expression "relative theory" used by Max Planck in 1906. The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories by
            Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity.
            General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical
            realm, including astronomy.
